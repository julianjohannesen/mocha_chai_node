// describe() is a way to group our tests in Mocha. We can also nest our tests as deeply as is necessary. describe() takes two arguments, the first is the name of the test group, and the second is a callback function.

  //it() is used for an individual test case. it() should be written as if you were saying it out loud: “It should equal zero”, “It should log the user in”, etc. it() takes two arguments, a string explaining what the test should do, and a callback function which contains our actual test
  it('is hooked up correctly', () => {
    //Perform a test to ensure that the required files are present.
    //"Expect x to equal y" is pretty much just what it sounds like. If x equals y, then your function, or in this case expression, passes the test, otherwise it fails.
